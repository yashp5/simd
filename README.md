# SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data)

SIMD is a type of parallel processing that allows a single instruction to be performed on multiple data points simultaneously. It's a form of data-level parallelism that's particularly useful for tasks that require the same operation to be performed on large sets of data.

## Basic Concept

Regular Processing:
```
Data1 -> Operation -> Result1
Data2 -> Operation -> Result2
Data3 -> Operation -> Result3
Data4 -> Operation -> Result4
```

SIMD Processing:
```
Data1, Data2, Data3, Data4 -> Operation -> Result1, Result2, Result3, Result4
(All processed simultaneously)
```

## Common Use Cases

- Graphics processing
- Audio/video processing
- Scientific computations
- Matrix operations
- Image processing

## Example in Code

```c
// Without SIMD
for(int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
    result[i] = a[i] + b[i];
}

// With SIMD (conceptual)
simd_add(result, a, b, 4); // Processes all 4 additions at once
```

## Real-world Implementations

- Intel's SSE and AVX instructions
- ARM's NEON technology
- PowerPC's AltiVec
- WebAssembly SIMD

## Benefits

- Improved performance
- Better computational efficiency
- Reduced power consumption
- Optimized memory bandwidth usage

# TODOs

## 1. Additional Vectorized Operations

### Subtraction, Multiplication, Division
- Extend from simple addition to other arithmetic operations
- For instance, `dst[i] = dst[i] * src[i]`

### Logical/Bitwise Operations
- Implement AND, OR, XOR on slices of uint64
- Sign/zero extension tricks on int64

### Floating-Point Support
- Use NEON instructions for 64-bit (or 32-bit) floating-point vectors
- Example: `fadd v0.2d, v0.2d, v1.2d` for double-precision floats

## 2. Larger Unrolling & Prefetching

### Unrolling
- Process 4 or 8 elements at a time with multiple NEON registers instead of 2 elements (128 bits)
- Reduce loop overhead and improve performance on larger arrays

### Prefetching
- Insert `prfm` instructions to bring future data into cache
- Reduce memory stall for large arrays

### Tuning for Microarchitecture
- Different Apple Silicon (M1, M2, etc.) might have different cache or pipeline characteristics
- Experiment with unroll + prefetch combinations for best throughput

## 3. More Complex Algorithms

### Vectorized Dot Product
- Combine multiplication and addition in a single pass
- Return final sum as a single result (summing partial sums in NEON registers)

### Matrix/Vector Routines
- Expand beyond 1D arrays
- Write functions for matrix-vector multiplication using NEON in assembly

### Convolution / Filtering
- Implement simple convolution filters in NEON for audio or image processing

## 4. Data Types & Edge Cases

### Multiple Data Types
- Provide separate entry points for int32, int16, or float64
- Each type requires different load/store instructions and lane widths

### Non-Equal Slice Lengths
- Offer partial overlap or auto-truncation to minimum length
- Improve current simple length equality check

### Alignment & Safety
- Investigate misaligned pointers
- Study performance variations with Apple Silicon unaligned accesses

## 5. Multi-Architecture Support

### x86_64 Implementation
- Provide SSE/AVX version for Intel/AMD processors
- Use cgo approach with .asm or .S for x86
- Use Go's build tags or file naming (_arm64 vs. _amd64)

### Fallback in Pure Go
- Include fallback implementation for unsupported architectures or older CPUs

## 6. Concurrency & Parallelism

### Goroutine-Based Parallel
- Process large slices in sub-blocks using multiple goroutines
- Each goroutine calls NEON routine on its portion
- Combine results as needed

### Work Stealing / Thread Pool
- Build pool for automatic task division among cores
- Optimize for big data arrays

## 7. Testing & Benchmarking

### Go Benchmarks
- Write Benchmark functions in _test.go files
- Measure throughput against pure-Go or scalar-assembly baseline

### Profiling Tools
- Use pprof or perf on Linux
- Identify memory bandwidth or compute bottlenecks

### Property-based Testing
- Use libraries like github.com/stretchr/testify/require or gotest.tools/assert
- Implement correctness checks on random data sets

## 8. Packaging & Distribution

### Library / Module
- Create reusable Go module
- Add proper versioning and documentation

### Cross-Compilation
- Handle separate .S files or use Docker images
- Support compilation for Apple Silicon and Intel

### CI Integration
- Set up GitHub Actions or other CI system
- Build and test on multiple OS/architecture combinations

## 9. Code Cleanliness & Maintenance

### In-Source Documentation
- Add detailed comments to assembly code
- Document register usage and loop unrolling strategy

### Error Handling / Panics
- Define behavior for length mismatches and negative lengths

### Type-Safe API
- Consider custom types (type Int64Slice []int64)
- Define interface for "vectorizable" data

## 10. Deeper NEON Exploration

### Advanced NEON Instructions
- Utilize mla, umlal, fmla, or fused instructions
- Experiment with shuffles and permutations (tbl, zip1, zip2)

### SVE (Scalable Vector Extension)
- Explore SVE for non-Apple Silicon ARM platforms
- Consider future direction for ARM HPC

# Summary

The project can be expanded in several ways:
- Extend to more data types and operations (floats, bitwise, matrix ops)
- Optimize with deeper unrolling, prefetching, concurrency
- Generalize to multiple architectures (x86_64 vs. ARM64)
- Polish with better testing, profiling, packaging, and CI

By iterating on these ideas, you'll gain deeper insight into low-level performance, ARM64 NEON capabilities, cgo intricacies, and cross-platform deployment.
